// Package githubactions checks GitHub Actions workflow files
// (.github/workflows/*.yml) for `uses:` references pinned older than
// what's actually released, using git-pkgs/manifests to parse the
// workflow and an injected resolver.Resolver to look up latest releases.
//
// Design notes (see chains-project/yul#4):
//
// Dispatch: every other ecosystem's checker owns a fixed manifest
// basename ("pom.xml", "package.json", ...), which is what
// manifestchecker.ManifestChecker.Filename() and the hook's
// filepath.Base() dispatch assume. Workflow files have arbitrary
// basenames (ci.yml, release.yml, ...) and are only identifiable by
// directory, so Checker instead implements manifestchecker.PathMatcher
// and is matched against the full path the hook was given.
//
// Tag vs. SHA pins: `uses:` refs are usually a mutable tag (@v4) or an
// immutable full commit SHA (the security-recommended pin, and the one
// GitHub's own hardening guidance and tools like StepSecurity's
// pin-github-actions push toward). There's no git-pkgs/vers scheme for
// GitHub Actions, and even if there were, "outdated" doesn't reduce to a
// semver comparison the way it does for the other ecosystems - a commit
// SHA isn't a version at all. So this checker doesn't reuse
// pins.ExactVersion/pins.Diff: it treats a ref as comparable when it
// matches vers.SemanticVersionRegex (an optional "v" then a leading
// digit), which a branch name never does and a bare SHA never does
// either. This is deliberately stricter than vers.Valid: that helper's
// generic fallback parser treats almost any hyphenated string as a
// "version" with an ignored non-numeric major (e.g. "not-a-version"
// parses "successfully" as major 0), which would make free-text comments
// and branch names like "release-4.0" look version-shaped when they
// aren't.
//
// A SHA pin conventionally carries its human-readable version alongside
// it as a trailing YAML comment, e.g.
// `uses: actions/checkout@<40-hex-sha> # v4.2.1`, specifically so tools
// (and reviewers) can tell what release the pin corresponds to without
// resolving the commit. Since that comment isn't part of
// git-pkgs/manifests' parsed dependency data, shaCommentPin does a second,
// regex-based pass over the raw content to recover it, and that recovered
// tag - not the SHA - is what gets compared and reported. This trusts the
// comment to accurately describe the pinned commit, same as Dependabot
// does; this checker has no independent way to confirm a SHA and its
// comment actually match, or that the tag it names is itself an immutable
// ref. A SHA with no such comment, or a branch pin, is left alone: there's
// nothing to compare it against.
//
// Resolution coverage: whether git-pkgs/enrichment's ecosyste.ms-backed
// resolver actually has LatestVersion data for pkg:githubactions purls
// wasn't verified against the live API when this was written (network
// access to packages.ecosyste.ms wasn't available in that environment).
// If it doesn't, every changed action reference simply fails to resolve,
// which - per pins.Diff's existing "no latest version found" behavior
// mirrored below - the hook already treats as fail-open (an unresolvable
// purl is a resolver error, not a mismatch), so this degrades safely to
// "never blocks" rather than blocking incorrectly.
