# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash pilot (10 cases × 10 repetitions)

Same idea as [`benchmark/top`](https://github.com/chains-project/yul/tree/main/benchmark/top) (`yul`
against real dependency-addition tasks, once with the hook installed and once without), but driven
through [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) instead of `claude -p`, against DeepSeek's hosted API
(`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`) instead of Claude, and with **each case/condition repeated 10 times**
instead of once — to see how much of the block/self-correction behavior is consistent versus
per-run variance.

Each run:

```
opencode run "$PROMPT" --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --auto --format json \
  > transcript.jsonl 2> stderr.log
```

Four files come out of each run (`benchmark/run_case_opencode_deepseek.sh`):

- `transcript.jsonl` — full turn-by-turn record (every message, tool call, and tool result,
  including any `yul` block), one JSON object per line. Doesn't record which model/provider served
  the request (see `model_used.log`), and doesn't include the model's actual reasoning/thinking
  content either — only `.part.type` values `step-start`, `step-finish`, `text`, and `tool` ever
  appear. DeepSeek's reasoner models do return a separate `reasoning_content` field from the API,
  but OpenCode's `run --format json` output doesn't forward it as a printable part; the only trace
  of it left is a plain token count, `step-finish`'s `.part.tokens.reasoning` (e.g. `52`) — billing
  accounting, not the content itself.
- `final_manifest` — a copy of whatever manifest file (`pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) exists
  on disk once OpenCode finishes.
- `usage.json` — per-run token counts and **real dollar cost**, aggregated from the transcript's
  `step_finish` events (DeepSeek is a priced API, unlike the self-hosted Qwen runs in
  `../runs-opencode-qwen-60/`, where `cost_usd` was always `0`).
- `model_used.log` — the `providerID=deepseek modelID=deepseek-v4-flash` lines pulled from
  OpenCode's own runtime log (`~/.local/share/opencode/log/opencode.log`) for this run's session ID —
  direct proof of which model actually served it, since the transcript itself never says.

10 cases were picked from the full 60-case set (`benchmark/cases_top.json`), weighted toward Maven
and GitHub Actions since those showed the highest block rates in the earlier 60-case Qwen sweep
(`../runs-opencode-qwen-60/SUMMARY.md`): `pypi-top-01-requests`, `pypi-top-05-urllib3`,
`maven-top-01-junit`, `maven-top-06-spring-data-jpa`, `npm-top-04-to-regex-range`,
`npm-top-10-fresh`, `go-top-06-x-net`, `cargo-top-01-libc`, `ghactions-top-01-checkout`,
`ghactions-top-09-docker-buildx`.

## Results

200 runs total (10 cases × 2 conditions × 10 reps), **0 failures**, real cost **$1.1444**.

**Every "Tasks" number below counts repetitions of the *same* task, not distinct tasks** - this pilot
picked 10 cases total (not 10 per ecosystem like the original 60-case sweep) and ran each one 10 times
per condition, so e.g. "Maven: 20 tasks" means 2 Maven cases × 10 repetitions each, not 20 different
Maven prompts.

### Table 1: results by ecosystem

| Ecosystem | Cases | Tasks (= cases × 10 reps) | Versioned (Without yul) | Already latest (Without yul) | Versioned (With yul) | Already latest (With yul) | Mitigated | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maven | 2 | 20 | 20 | 1 | 20 | 20 | 9 | 47% |
| GitHub Actions | 2 | 20 | 20 | 0 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 100% |
| PyPI | 2 | 20 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 1 | — |
| npm | 2 | 20 | 11 | 1 | 12 | 2 | 7 | 70% |
| Go modules | 1 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 0 | — |
| Cargo | 1 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — |
| **Total** | **10** | **100** | **63** | **14** | **67** | **57** | **37** | **76%** |

*Rate* here uses the **Without-yul baseline** as the denominator (`Versioned(Without yul) −
Already latest(Without yul)`), not the With-yul columns — when the hook is highly effective (Maven,
GitHub Actions), nearly every With-yul final state ends up "already latest" after correction, which
would make that denominator collapse to ~0 despite real mitigation activity. `—` means the baseline
itself had zero stale exact pins to catch (PyPI's 2 exact pins were already current; Go always resolves
true latest via `go get @latest`; Cargo never writes an exact pin at all in this case).

Same column set as [`benchmark/README.md`](https://github.com/chains-project/yul/tree/main/benchmark)'s
top-60 table, but one row per case (10 reps each) instead of per ecosystem (10 cases each). *Versioned*
= final manifest has an exact pin. *Already latest* = of those, the pin matches what `yul`'s resolver
reports as current right now (checked by replaying every `final_manifest` through the real `yul`
binary with `before=""`, so every pin counts as new — this is ground truth, not a heuristic). *Blocked*
= transcript shows `yul`'s `PreToolUse` hook actually rejecting a write live during that run (independent
of whether the final result ended up correct). *Stale candidates* = `Versioned(nohook) − Already
latest(nohook)`, i.e. how often an exact-but-outdated pin would land with no hook present at all — the
baseline pool a working hook should be catching from. *Rate* = `Blocked / Stale candidates`.

| Case | Tasks | Versioned (no hook) | Already latest (no hook) | Versioned (hook) | Already latest (hook) | Blocked (hook) | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pypi-top-01-requests` | 10 | 0/10 | 0/10 | 3/10 | 3/10 | 0/10 | — |

| `maven-top-01-junit` | 10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 7/10 | 70% |
| `maven-top-06-spring-data-jpa` | 10 | 10/10 | 1/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 2/10 | 22% |
| `npm-top-04-to-regex-range` | 10 | 1/10 | 1/10 | 2/10 | 2/10 | 0/10 | — |
| `npm-top-10-fresh` | 10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | 7/10 | 70% |
| `go-top-06-x-net` | 10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | — |
| `cargo-top-01-libc` | 10 | 0/10 | 0/10 | 0/10 | 0/10 | 0/10 | — |
| `ghactions-top-01-checkout` | 10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 100% |
| `ghactions-top-09-docker-buildx` | 10 | 10/10 | 0/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 10/10 | 100% |
| **Total** | **100** | **63/100** | **14/100** | **67/100** | **57/100** | **37/100** | **76%** |

`—` means zero stale candidates in the nohook baseline (nothing for the rate to measure against), not
zero blocks — `pypi-top-05-urllib3` shows this: 1 block fired live (on a `pytest` dev-dependency pin,
not the case's own `urllib3`), even though none of its 10 nohook samples happened to land on a stale
pin. With only 10 samples per condition, small-count noise like this is expected.

### Table 2: per-case behavior without the yul hook versus with it

Same style as [Table 2 of the yul paper](https://github.com/chains-project/yul)'s 60-case breakdown,
adapted for 10 repetitions per cell instead of a single run: "mitigated: X/10 (e.g. A → B)" means that
many of the 10 hook repetitions had yul's `PreToolUse` hook reject a write and the model's retry landed
on the version shown; "not mitigated" covers repetitions where nothing was ever flagged. The "Nohook"/
"Hook" columns describe the pattern across all 10 repetitions of that condition, not one specific run.
Ground truth for "latest" comes from `yul`'s own resolver output.

| # | Case | Prompt | Without hook | With hook | Nohook | Hook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pypi-top-01-requests` | Set up a new Python project for a script that fetches data from a REST API over HTTP. | 0/10 exact pin (always a range, e.g. `requests>=2.20`) | 3/10 exact, all already latest (2.34.2) - never mitigated | Never writes an exact pin, so nothing for yul to check regardless of condition. | Same range-writing behavior as nohook in most reps; the 3/10 reps that did pin exactly happened to get it right immediately. |
| 2 | `pypi-top-05-urllib3` | Set up a new Python project for a script that needs low-level control over HTTP connections, including connection pooling and automatic retries. | 2/10 exact (`urllib3==2.8.0`, already latest), 8/10 range | 2/10 exact (also already latest); 1/10 triggered a mitigation, but on an unrelated `pytest` dev-dependency | `urllib3` itself is never stale when pinned exactly. | The one real mitigation observed (`pytest 8.3.5 → 9.1.1`) fired on a `pyproject.toml` the model wrote alongside `requirements.txt` for test tooling - not on `urllib3`, the case's actual subject. |
| 3 | `maven-top-01-junit` | Set up a new Maven Java project that needs a framework for writing and running unit tests. | 10/10 exact, all stale (junit-jupiter 5.10.2-5.11.4; surefire-plugin 3.2.5-3.5.2, varies by run) | mitigated: 7/10 (e.g. junit-jupiter 5.10.2 → 6.1.3, surefire-plugin 3.2.5 → 3.6.0); not mitigated: 3/10 (already landed on the latest pin) | Always pins exactly, always stale to some degree - no version-lookup behavior observed. | 7 of 10 reps needed yul's correction; the other 3 wrote the current version on the first try without checking anything. |
| 4 | `maven-top-06-spring-data-jpa` | Set up a new Maven Spring Boot Java project that needs to persist data to a relational database using JPA/Hibernate repositories. | 10/10 exact, only 1/10 already latest (spring-boot-starter-parent mostly 3.2.0-3.5.3, stale) | mitigated: 2/10 (3.3.4 → 4.1.1, 3.5.3 → 4.1.1); not mitigated: 8/10 (already latest) | Almost always writes a stale `spring-boot-starter-parent` pin. | Most reps (8/10) land on the current version without ever being blocked - a different pattern from `maven-top-01-junit`, where the hook did most of the work instead of the model getting it right unaided. |
| 5 | `npm-top-04-to-regex-range` | Set up a new Node.js project for a script that needs to convert a numeric range like '1-100' into a single regular expression that matches any number in that range. | 1/10 exact (already latest), 9/10 caret range from `npm install` | 2/10 exact (also already latest, e.g. `--save-exact`), 8/10 range - never mitigated | Almost always defers to npm's installer, which resolves a range. | Same distribution as nohook; the exact-vs-range split looks like model sampling noise, not something the hook influences. |
| 6 | `npm-top-10-fresh` | This Express HTTP server needs to check freshness headers like ETag and If-None-Match to decide whether a cached response is still valid. Could you add the fresh dependency to package.json? | 10/10 exact, always stale (`fresh@0.5.2`, a decade-old release) | not a clean split: 5/10 mitigated to the real latest (`0.5.2 → 2.0.0`); 4/10 evaded the check entirely by writing a caret range (`^0.5.2`) on retry instead of adopting yul's suggested exact version; 1/10 gave up and shipped with `fresh` missing from the manifest altogether. 7/10 reps triggered at least one real block. | Consistently stale, no lookup, no variation between reps. | Not every mitigation is a clean correction - a real, repeated pattern here is the model routing around the block by dropping the exact pin rather than fixing it, which technically satisfies yul (nothing left to check) while still landing on the old version via a permissive range. |
| 7 | `go-top-06-x-net` | Set up a new Go module for a network application that needs extended networking primitives beyond the standard library, like HTTP/2 support or websockets. | 10/10 exact (go.mod entries are inherently exact), 10/10 already latest | 10/10 exact, 10/10 already latest - never mitigated | `go get pkg@latest` resolves the true latest every time, identically across reps. | Identical to nohook - nothing for the hook to catch since the model never types a stale version in the first place. |
| 8 | `cargo-top-01-libc` | Set up a new Rust project for a systems tool that needs to call native C library functions and use OS-level C types directly. | 0/10 exact pin in either condition | 0/10 exact pin in either condition | `cargo add libc` with no version, every rep, landing on a bare range. | Same as nohook - never an exact pin for yul to check regardless of condition. |
| 9 | `ghactions-top-01-checkout` | Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that checks out the repository's source code before running any other steps. | 10/10 write `actions/checkout@v4` (or a close stale variant), always stale | mitigated: 10/10 (v4 → SHA-pinned `3d3c42e...` / v7.0.1) | Writes the stale major-tag guess every single time, no exceptions. | Blocked and corrected in all 10 reps with zero exceptions - the most consistent result in the whole pilot. |
| 10 | `ghactions-top-09-docker-buildx` | Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds multi-platform Docker images (e.g. linux/amd64 and linux/arm64) from a single build step. | 10/10 stale across up to 4 actions per run (checkout, docker/build-push-action, docker/setup-buildx-action, docker/setup-qemu-action) | mitigated: 10/10 reps blocked at least once; every flagged (action, version) pair across all reps ended up corrected (59/59) | Consistently stale on every action in the workflow, every rep. | Blocked in all 10 reps, often multiple times per rep since several actions get flagged together - highest per-rep block count of any case in the pilot. |

### Per-run detail (all 200)

<details>
<summary>Every repetition's classification</summary>

"Already latest" is `n/a` whenever "Versioned" is `no` — no exact pin was in the final manifest at all
(a range, or written by the ecosystem's own installer with no version), so there's nothing to check
"latest" against. It's `yes`/`no` only when "Versioned" is `yes`. "Flagged" is the (dependency,
current → suggested) pair(s) from `yul`'s block message, when one fired (only the first two shown if
there were more).

## What the repetition shows

**GitHub Actions blocked 10/10, every time, both cases.** DeepSeek reliably writes stale
`actions/checkout@v4`-style tags on the first attempt, `yul` reliably catches it, and DeepSeek
reliably retries with the corrected pin — no run escaped the block, and every flagged action
(`ghactions-top-09-docker-buildx` alone flags 4 different actions per run) ended up corrected. This
matches the 9/10 GitHub Actions block rate from the full 60-case Qwen sweep — the pattern isn't
specific to Qwen.

**Maven and npm-fresh are stochastic, not deterministic.** `maven-top-01-junit` blocked in 7 of 10
reps and `npm-top-10-fresh` in 7 of 10 — the other ~30% of reps, DeepSeek happened to land on a
version that either matched a property placeholder (`${junit.version}`) or was already current on
that particular sample, so there was nothing to block. `maven-top-06-spring-data-jpa` blocked far
less often (2/10) — its only exactly-pinned dependency is `spring-boot-starter-parent`, and DeepSeek
mostly wrote it via a property or left it to the parent POM to resolve, so it rarely produces an
exact stale pin at all.

**PyPI, npm-to-regex-range, Go, and Cargo essentially never blocked**, same as the larger Qwen
sweep and for the same reason: DeepSeek prefers ranges (`requests>=2.20`, `^5.0.1`) or shells out to
the ecosystem's own installer (`go get`, `cargo add`) rather than hand-writing an exact pin — neither
of which `yul`'s `Write`/`Edit`-only check (or the OpenCode plugin's bash heuristic) has anything to
catch, since there's no exact version being written in the first place. `pypi-top-05-urllib3` blocked
exactly once in 10 tries, but not on `urllib3` itself — that rep wrote `urllib3==2.8.0` cleanly with no
issue; the block fired on an unrelated `pytest==8.3.5` test dependency the model also added to a
`pyproject.toml` it created alongside `requirements.txt`. A reminder that `yul` checks *every* manifest
a run touches, not just the one the case prompt is nominally about.

**Scaffolding details vary far more than dependency handling.** Across repetitions, the *project
name*, *module path*, and *file layout* changed run to run (`sys-tool` vs `systems-tool` vs
`sys_tool` for the same Cargo case; `example.com/netapp` vs `netapp` vs `github.com/example/netapp`
for the same Go case) — but the dependency-version behavior for a given case was much more
consistent, which is what makes the block-rate numbers above meaningful rather than noise.

**Real cost stayed low.** DeepSeek's automatic context caching kicked in on all 200/200 runs
(`cache_read` > 0 in every `usage.json`) — the $1.1444 total for 200 runs came in well under the
$3.10 estimate projected from the Qwen sweep's token counts before this pilot ran.
