#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs one benchmark case under one condition (hook|nohook), same as
# run_case_opencode.sh, but against DeepSeek's API via OpenCode's built-in
# "deepseek" provider (models.dev catalog) instead of a self-hosted,
# OpenAI-compatible endpoint - no custom provider config needed.
#
# The actual `opencode run` happens inside a fresh Apptainer container per
# invocation (see opencode-sandbox.def/.sif) with only this run's own
# WORKDIR bind-mounted - a model's bash/read tools can't see sibling runs'
# directories at all, unlike the un-sandboxed version, where a run was
# caught `cat`-ing a completed sibling repetition's manifest instead of
# doing the task itself. Build the image once with:
#   apptainer build benchmark/opencode-sandbox.sif benchmark/opencode-sandbox.def
#
# Credentials come from OpenCode's own store (`opencode auth login`, saved
# to ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json), not an env var - this script never
# reads or holds the API key, so it can't leak it. (Earlier versions passed
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY through the environment; a run's bash tool dumped its own
# env and the real key ended up in a committed transcript. See the
# opencode-deepseek branch history.)
#
# Usage:
#   run_case_opencode_deepseek.sh <cases.json> <case_id> <hook|nohook> <output_dir> [model_id] [repeat_index]
#
#   model_id      opencode model spec provider/model (default:
#                 deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash).
#   repeat_index  if set, run output goes to <condition>/run-<repeat_index>/
#                 instead of directly under <condition>/ - use for repeated
#                 runs of the same case/condition.
#
# Env vars:
#   YUL_BIN       path to the yul binary the hook condition execs
#                 (default: "yul" on PATH; build one with `go build -o yul .`)
#   OPENCODE_BIN  path to the opencode binary (default: "opencode" on PATH)

#
# --containall --no-mount bind-paths are load-bearing, not decorative: this
# cluster's system-wide apptainer.conf has `bind path = /proj`, which
# Apptainer auto-mounts into every container at the same absolute path
# regardless of the explicit --bind list below - without opting out, the
# model could still `cat /proj/.../run-1/pom.xml` and see a sibling rep,
# same bug as before just via an absolute path instead of a relative one.
# Verified empirically: /proj is unreachable inside the container with
# these two flags, present without them.
#
# --containall's minimal /etc also drops the host's /etc/resolv.conf, which
# breaks DNS for the actual DeepSeek API call - bound back in explicitly
# below (read-only) since it doesn't reintroduce any of the /proj exposure
# the two flags above are closing.
#
# Cache dirs: yul's release binary and the opencode-yul plugin package are
# shared read-write across all containers (safe to race on - worst case is
# a redundant re-download, no per-run data in either). Everything under
# .local/share/opencode (sessions, snapshots, its own log) is NOT shared -
# each run gets a throwaway one, with only auth.json bind-mounted in
# read-only from the real one, so the container can authenticate without
# ever seeing another run's session state or writing into the real one.
